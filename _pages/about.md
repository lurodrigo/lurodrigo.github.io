This is my personal blog, where I'll supposedly write about whatever comes to my mind. 9 out of 10 times, it's either
mathematics or programming. I've been coding for more than half my life already. I wrote my first program when I was 13, the same age I got a bronze medal in the Brazilian Olympiad of Informatics. I have an outstanding academic record, having 
dropped out from three of the most prestigious Brazilian universities :) 

Besides the usual nerdy stuff, I'm interested in history, sociology, anthropology, music, and dharmic traditions. I love nature, cycling, swimming, and living in one of the most beautiful places in the world, Rio!
